# PDFs Directory

This directory can be used to store sample PDF files for testing purposes.

## Usage

This directory is optional and mainly for development/testing. In production, PDFs are typically hosted on external platforms like:

- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- AWS S3
- Other cloud storage services

## File Organization

If you choose to store PDFs locally:
- Organize by course: `course-name/document.pdf`
- Use descriptive filenames
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 10MB recommended)

## Security Note

When hosting PDFs externally, ensure:
- Files are publicly accessible (if needed)
- URLs are stable and won't change
- Consider using direct download links
- Implement proper access controls if needed
